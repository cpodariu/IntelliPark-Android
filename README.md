# IntelliPark-Android
Android app developed at Megahack 2017

Our solution

A system that takes into consideration many factors like position in the company, age in the company, punctuality of arrival when having a reserved parking spot etc and assigns parking spots for each of the employee.

On the Android app, the employee will receive a notification when the server allocates the space and can see the whole parking lot and his/her place marked with green. If he/she doesn’t want to come with the car, he can drop the parking spot for the next person in the queue. If the user chooses to come with the car, he/she can make a posting to pick up somebody who wasn’t assigned a spot in order to reduce traffic and promote ride sharing.
